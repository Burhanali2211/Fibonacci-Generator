# Fibonacci GUI Application

## Overview
This is a simple Fibonacci series generator built using **PyQt6**. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can input a number (N) and generate the Fibonacci series up to the Nth term. The generated series is displayed in a scrollable area, and users can save or load the results from a file.

## Features
- **Generate Fibonacci Series**: Enter a number and generate the series up to that term.
- **Scrollable Output**: Displays long Fibonacci sequences neatly.
- **Save to File**: Save the generated series to a text file.
- **Load from File**: Load a previously saved Fibonacci series.
- **Clear Output**: Clear the displayed series and input field.
- **Error Handling**: Validates input and provides error messages.
- **Resizable Window**: Properly adjusts UI components when resized.
